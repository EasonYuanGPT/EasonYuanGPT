👋 Hi, I’m @EasonYuanGPT

👀 I’m interested in automating instruments, enhancing Building Management Systems (BMS), and applying AI tools to solve real-world problems. My passion lies in exploring how technology can make our environments smarter, more efficient, and sustainable.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in AI and Machine Learning, with a particular focus on their application in IoT (Internet of Things) for smart buildings and automation systems. I am also diving into data analysis and visualization to better understand system performances and make data-driven decisions.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to integrate AI with BMS and automation to innovate in the field of smart buildings and environmental management. I believe that through collaboration, we can develop solutions that are not only technologically advanced but also practical and beneficial for society.

📫 How to reach me: You can reach me through GitHub issues and discussions on my projects, or directly send an email to [your-email-address]. I'm open to discussions, project collaborations, and networking with professionals sharing similar interests.
